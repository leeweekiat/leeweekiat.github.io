Hi! I am an assistant professor in the the Division of Information Technology & Operations Management, Nanyang Business School, Nanyang Technological University. I received my Ph.D. from the [Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/programs/phd-program/) at Cornell University in 2023. 

My current research interests include platform operations, gig economy, and workforce management. I use both analytical and empirical approaches to generate managerial insights. Feel free to look at my [CV](https://leeweekiat.github.io/cv/) and visit my official site at [NBS](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00270) to know more about my experiences.
